Git, GitHub, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX

The user will specify a city in the United States to begin the search. From there, the user will be prompted to provide addtional information regarding the desired cuisine, experience, and establishment, all of which are optional but will help narrow the search. Upon searching, the application will display the top six results based on the user's search. Each result contains the restaurant name, an image if it is provided by Zomato (a third-party API), the restaurant's address, which is linked to a Google Map modal showcasing its location, and the phone number, which can be called from the app.
